# The front-end of a simple chat application

This is the front-end of a simple chat application I made to practise and refresh my knowledge in React, and use Rails ActionCable from an API.
To clone and run this:
* Node version: 22.11.0
* NPM version: 10.9.0
* Then run `npm i` and `npm run dev` and visit `https://localhost:5173` in your browser and you should see it, provided the [back-end](https://github.com/williamgrant04/chatServer) is also running.
